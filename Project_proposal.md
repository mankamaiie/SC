# Project Proposal
---
### For my project, I decided to explore the mic synth. I want to create a nice synth which I'll "connect" to the microphone. I'm not sure yet which idea will be behind and what this performance will showcase, but I hope it's going to be interesting.

### I found some tutorials on how to avoid feedback, so I thought this would be very helpful for my project.
